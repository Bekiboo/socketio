# Overview

In Cube, you play a cube that has to avoid other cubes, and this on a cubic platform. The goal is to survive as long as possible. The game is over when the player's cube lose all its health points.
Move around with WASD or the arrow keys.

I wrote this game to learn how to use Svelte and Three.js, and to have fun. I also wanted to learn how to use a physics engine in a game and Rapier.js seemed like a good choice. Also, Threlte is an excellent wrapper for these three technologies, so I wanted to try it out.

Three.js, for the 3D rendering of the game.
Threlte, as a wrapper for Svelte and Three.js to make the development of the game easier.
Rapier.js, for the physics engine of the game.
